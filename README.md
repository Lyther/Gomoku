 Artificial Intelligence to play Gomoku


This is my AI course's project 1, use AI (search in fact) to play Gomoku with others, the winner would got higher grade.
File "main.py" is the whole AI project, "test.py" is for unit test that after coding.
If you want to run the program, there is two files named "code_check.py" and "code_check_test.py", then you can run the "code_check.py" to see how my program pass the test cases.
However, there isn't user interface, and the program can only be used to run in the online judge.
